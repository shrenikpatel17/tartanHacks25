# Project Overview
This Chrome extension helps language learners enhance their vocabulary and speaking skills through immersive learning during their everyday web browsing. Users can select their target language and proficiency level, and the system will automatically customized the learning content.

# Core Features

## Text Learning:
Based on the user's proficiency level, the extension automatically selects 5 words from the webpage and translates them into the target language. Users can click on a word to view its meaning in their native language. Words clicked three times are added to the Word Bank for review and reinforcement.

## Image Learning:
The extension provides concise captions for images in the target language. Additionally, it can extract and translate text embedded in images, helping users learn through visual content.

## Interactive Chat:
With the built-in chatbot, users can discuss webpage content or YouTube videos in the target language. The chatbot simulates conversations with a native speaker, providing an engaging way to improve speaking skills.

# Key Highlights
Unlike traditional language learning tools, our extension eliminates the need for deliberate study. Instead, it seamlessly integrates language learning into users' daily activities, such as browsing the web or watching videos. By combining text, images, video, and interactive chat, we deliver a comprehensive and immersive learning experience.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
